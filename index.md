### Day 1 - Introduction to Bonsai
- Introduction to Bonsai. What is visual reactive programming?
- Real-time tracking of colored objects, moving objects and contrasting objects.
- Measuring behavior using voltages and an Arduino.
- Data synchronization and measuring closed-loop latency.
- Creating dynamic observable sequences with higher-order operators.
- Modeling trial sequences: states, events, and side-effects.
- Reproducible deployment and versioning of experiments.
- Interfacing Bonsai with Python.

### Day 2 - Hands-on Workshop
- Conditional effects. Triggering a stimulus based on video activity.
- Continuous feedback. Modulate stimulus intensity with speed or distance.
- Feedback stabilization. Record video centered around a moving object.
- Real-time markerless pose tracking using [Bonsai + DeepLabCut](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/deeplabcut){:target="_blank"} and [Bonsai + SLEAP](https://github.com/bonsai-rx/sleap){:target="_blank"}.
- Driving state transitions with external inputs.
- Choice, timeouts and conditional logic. Building reaction time and Go/No-Go tasks.
- Building closed-loop virtual reality experiments with [BonVision](https://bonvision.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
- Bonsai hackathon.
